b_DkQrJxpck,Terrific video on an important topic. Very helpful.,2024-06-18T18:11:26Z
b_DkQrJxpck,"Thank you very much, bro!
Excellent and clearly understandable example",2024-05-12T20:29:20Z
b_DkQrJxpck,"man I have rewatched this video so many times this weekend, you made me change my whole code
this video literally took me out of tutorial hell, 100% recommended
I never understood inheritance and how to pass a whole game object into another engine object until now... you made me convert all of my noob code into very concise functions...
this is one of the best tutorials and channels I've found so far about pygame, thanks! please keep the videos coming you're an amazing teacher!",2024-02-19T19:38:31Z
b_DkQrJxpck,"Hey friend, how do I create usable items, like potions, in PyGame?",2024-02-01T13:38:41Z
b_DkQrJxpck,Awesome info! Thank you so much :),2023-08-25T06:04:08Z
b_DkQrJxpck,Great tutorial! Do you have any idea how to add a txt map to the game world?,2023-03-10T14:42:51Z
b_DkQrJxpck,WOAH!,2023-02-05T17:01:58Z
b_DkQrJxpck,"Thanks a lot for this! I 've been learning to program with pygame and its been hard. Your explanations are good and i just changed it a little to fit my first project.
I also run self.state_stack[-1].events() in main loop events so i can control diferent set of keys :)",2023-02-01T15:42:36Z
b_DkQrJxpck,Your tutorials are the best Iâ€™ve seen!!,2023-01-09T23:52:49Z
b_DkQrJxpck,"Honestly one of the worst tutorials for someone who has already been building a game for a while, hard to implement and pair up  variables from your specific use case, to mine.",2023-01-09T17:42:09Z
b_DkQrJxpck,thank you so much for this video! you are the best!!,2022-11-26T15:51:06Z
b_DkQrJxpck,"Excellent tutorial! I've been looking into game screens using state pattern and this is really helpful.

The only thing I missed was a state diagram showing the state and their transitions, without it it's too magical (too much on-the-mind vs on-the-world knowledge) to know where to put the key handlers + enter_state calls.",2022-08-24T16:50:37Z
b_DkQrJxpck,it doesn't work  can u help me  ? i want to change the player where can I  found it ? and I want to add more menu,2022-08-01T07:47:49Z
b_DkQrJxpck,"This really brings some structure into my game loop. But I still have 3 questions:
1. What do we use the game.state_stack variable for? I understand that it represents the state stack, but why do we need it when all the state instances are chained together?
2. Why do we check if the state stack's length is > 1 before we add the entering state on top? Wouldn't that mean that if its length is exactly 1, nothing would ever be added?
3. Game.update() only says ""pass"" - how is control transferred to the various states?",2022-07-05T19:27:17Z
b_DkQrJxpck,"Great tutorial and explanation! I have a quick question: using this OOP template, how would one add text to menus?",2022-06-24T23:44:40Z
b_DkQrJxpck,Thank you! What an amazing tutorial.,2022-03-31T13:53:29Z
b_DkQrJxpck,"Very thx you for your tutorials.
Very clean/clear. I appreciate to observe your organisation/structuration of your code too.
Thx a lot !!",2022-03-14T09:44:41Z
b_DkQrJxpck,I watched your video on how to create a tilemap but how would i implement it into something like this,2022-02-22T23:09:02Z
b_DkQrJxpck,OMG I am currently participating in a game jam and your tutorials are SO USEFUL !!! thank you so much for doing them ! you deserve so much more views !,2022-02-08T20:06:44Z
b_DkQrJxpck,"I did this and now idk how to continue, are any videos continuing parts of this one?",2022-02-03T19:07:17Z
b_DkQrJxpck,"What is 'states.state'. It doesnt seem to be working for me. saying something like 
' from states.Title import Title



ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'states.Title'; 'states' is not a package'",2021-12-07T20:09:27Z
b_DkQrJxpck,underrated.,2021-11-28T11:24:59Z
b_DkQrJxpck,What a great video!,2021-11-16T07:35:01Z
b_DkQrJxpck,"Hey Christian, thank you for all that videos, they was very helpful for me. 
I'm creating the Plants vs Zombies in Pygame. It's almost done, but I need to implement a leaderboard function in this project, using SQLite (DataBase).
Can you have any idea to how can I create this ?

Thanks for the help!!",2021-11-02T19:02:37Z
b_DkQrJxpck,"Thanks for this. Can I ask, how to apply collision for the player?",2021-10-22T08:35:35Z
b_DkQrJxpck,"This is fantastic!!! I wish you would make a series around this simple concept.  Like two small tile maps (or images) that you toggle between when you reach an edge (is that a new state? ). Or using text with a changing menu box size.  Ex. If you expand magic maybe youâ€™ve earned fire so one size box and later get healing.  How do you automatically change the menu size instead of manually coding a different box.  Or making a long string of text auto return inside a standard box for dialogue.    

I think your videos are best because it feels like you are setting us up to make large polished complicated games.",2021-09-04T18:28:06Z
b_DkQrJxpck,"Awesome video! Question though, you wrote  from states.state import State in the title.py module because it refers to the top level script?",2021-08-02T10:36:55Z
b_DkQrJxpck,"I love your tutorials , they are very clear and helpful for newbies, could you make a inventory system tutorial in pygame ?  Thanks",2021-07-23T15:24:53Z

b_DkQrJxpck,love your content! thanks a bunch.,2021-06-26T22:01:54Z
b_DkQrJxpck,"I was pausing and typing in your code along with the video. I'm using Sublime, so I'm running the game from the terminal. I kept getting a black screen, so I started searching for errors. I gave up and just copy and pasted all your code. I'm still just getting a blank pygame window when I run it. Any suggestions?",2021-06-25T05:50:33Z
b_DkQrJxpck,Why does it have so few views?? I think everyone should learn from this video,2021-06-24T14:33:33Z

b_DkQrJxpck,Oh my god this video was amazing,2021-06-23T00:20:37Z
Q6CCdCBVypg,"Hey everybody! In the spirit of learning, here are some ideas you can try and implement if you finished the video and are looking to add a bit more to this project.

Exercise: Allow the players to put in their names so it doesn't just say ""Player 1"" and ""Player 2"" 
Exercise: Add a timer to the game so that each player only has a certain amount of time to make a decision (hint: checkout the built in ""time"" module)
Exercise: Add an option to replay the game when it ends. Also add a game counter to keep track of how many times each player has won.

Challenge Exercise: Add a single player mode with some AI functionality for the second player. It doesn't need to be a fancy algorithm, just think about how you can have the program make a valid move. Once you get it working, see if you can come up with something better! 


Happy coding!",2022-08-10T06:46:48Z
Q6CCdCBVypg,i don't know if this is begginer tutorial. There are lots of lambda functions to save lines.,2024-12-06T20:06:28Z
Q6CCdCBVypg,"It was a great tutorial, very easy to follow. But one thing i am not able to grasp completely. Why did we call the check_turn function to check who the winner is? I mean the check turn function only returns the number of turn. Or what i am able to understand is, that as soon as the player 1 (let's say) is done with their final winning turn, this function return that and the winner is declared! please help me understand this. thankyou!
And once again, great tutorial!",2024-10-21T10:10:44Z

Q6CCdCBVypg,Which application are you using??,2023-12-23T14:06:22Z

Q6CCdCBVypg,i have just started python and it was very  good experience thanks,2023-04-04T10:49:23Z
Q6CCdCBVypg,Thank you! This was a great learning experience for me to follow along with and rebuild. Taught me some new tricks as a beginner to Python and was useful for fulfilling a project requirement for my course work.,2023-02-20T21:46:51Z
Q6CCdCBVypg,Thank you for the video.  I tweaked the code so that you could choose 1 or 2 players and play the computer.,2023-01-02T03:45:37Z
Q6CCdCBVypg,can it be run on vs code?,2022-12-27T07:31:13Z
Q6CCdCBVypg,"Hi! I think your logic is great here! I am very much a beginner in python and am curious if you have any *hints* to implemting another game play? does turn = 0 need to be reset somehow? 
I am trying to implent best 2/3 gameplay to your code. I feel very far off. I started as:

if finished:
    if what_turn(turn) == 'X':
        print(""Player1 is the Winner!"")
    else:
        print(""Player2 is the Winner!"")
else:
    print(""NO game!"")
    print('Do you want to play again?(Y/N)')
    play_again = input().lower()
    gameplay = True
    if play_again == 'n':
        gameplay= False
        print('\nThanks for playing!')",2022-12-09T13:40:35Z
