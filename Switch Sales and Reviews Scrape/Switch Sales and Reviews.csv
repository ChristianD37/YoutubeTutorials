The Pokémon Legends: Arceus game honors past Pokémon games' core gameplay while infusing new action and RPG elements. You'll need to catch, survey, and research wild Pokémon in a long-gone era of the Sinnoh region to create and complete the region's first Pokédex. 

-Catch Pokémon-
To catch Pokémon in the Pokémon Legends: Arceus game, you can observe them to learn their behavior, then carefully sneak up, aim your Poké Ball, and let fly!

You can also have your ally Pokémon battle wild Pokémon that you hope to catch. Just throw the Poké Ball holding your ally Pokémon near a wild Pokémon, and you'll seamlessly enter battle and command your Pokémon by choosing from moves it knows.

-An Adventure in the Sinnoh of Days Gone By-
You'll be brought to the Sinnoh region, the setting for the Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl games. But this story unfolds in a long-gone era, before ideas such as being a Pokémon Trainer or having a Pokémon League even existed.

All around, you'll find Pokémon living wild in harsh environments that make for a Sinnoh unlike the region you may remember from the days of the Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl games.

The Poké Balls of old were apparently built a little differently from the ones we know so well. They were made mostly of wood, and steam puffed from their tops when Pokémon were caught. 

-Meet Your First Partner Pokémon-
As you start off on your adventure to create the region's first Pokédex, you'll be able to choose Rowlet, Cyndaquil, or Oshawott as a partner.

Cyndaquil

Type: Fire
Height: 1'8""
Weight: 17.4 lbs.

Oshawott is a Pokémon from the Unova region. With the scalchop on its stomach, it blocks opponents' attacks, then retaliates immediately by slashing. Its scalchop can be used to break open hard Berries as well.

Arceus
Holding the key to this tale is the Pokémon known as Arceus. Arceus is said to have shaped all there is in this world. Just how is this mighty Pokémon connected to your journey?
